# Facial Expression Recognition

Ah, facial expression recognition (FER)! It's a fascinating field at the intersection of computer vision, psychology, and artificial intelligence.

What specifically would you like to know about it? I can help you with:

Understanding the basics of FER: How does it work? What emotions can it recognize?
Exploring the technical aspects: Different algorithms, datasets, and challenges in developing accurate FER models.
Discussing the applications of FER: From human-computer interaction to mental health monitoring.
Pointing you to resources: Tutorials, research papers, and open-source projects related to FER.

This repository contains the code and resources for a project that utilizes machine learning to recognize facial expressions in real-time.

## Key Features:

Real-time Expression Detection: Accurately identifies emotions from live video streams or webcam input.
Supported Expressions: Detects a range of common emotions, typically including:
Anger
Sadness
Fear
Happiness
Surprise
Disgust
Neutral
Customizable Model: Ability to train and integrate different machine learning models for expression recognition.
Potential Applications:
